# 100 Days of Code challenge

Started by creating a Jekyll page follwing [TechTeim's Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8iOU1ci19Q). A couple of things were not mentioned such as the need to install Ruby. I was able to figure this out following the Jekyll documentation. I also had trouble getting the posts to show, but I found out that they need a date stamp at the beginning. Thanks to [MyCyberUniverse](https://mycyberuniverse.com/jekyll-post-not-showing-up.html)for the information.

I plan to continue my coding training starting with SQL. My plan is to follow the book *[Practical SQL 2nd Edition](https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition)*

## Github

It is my plan to update my blog at least once a week and show my progress.
